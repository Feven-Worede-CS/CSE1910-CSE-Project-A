## Materials & Methods
_What programing language will you be using? If you are not planing to use Processing explain why you chose a different programing language._ I am pallning to use Processing 2.2.1

## Program Specifications
_Fully describe your project below in one paragraph (minimum 5 sentences). Is it a game? A tool? If it is a game, what game genre is it?_
My projet is called the Matching Memory Game. It will presnet the user 8 cards. The cards will have a front and backside. Each card will have teh same front(a picture of a happy face) but the backside of each acrds will be different. Tha backside will from the value of an Ace to a King. The game will have the front side facing the user meaning only the smiley face will be visible. The user will click each card to check the value and if he clicks two that have the exact same value it will be a match. If teh user clicks one card and then another card and they are not mattches, the user will have to press the "Flip" button to turn them back over to the smiley face front side.
## Potential Challenges
_Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?_
In the video I am following step by step to create this game. The Creator of the game in the video of the original stated her timer did not work so she came up with a solution to  create a manual flip button instead of a timer that automatically flips once it hits 0 on the clock. I am planniog to slove this issue and create a timer using a video that explains how to creat a built in time using Processing. If I fail to create the timer, I will also create a manual "flip" button just as the original creator.

# Evaluation
## 60%
_What will a 60% project look like?  In other words, what is the minimum expectations you have for yourself?  List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 60%._
The minimum expectations I have for myself is to complete the pitch, proposal perfectly  but the actual game isnt exactly what the proposal stated. The game lacks features and promises that the proposal stated it would contain.
## 80%
_What does 80% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 80%._
The project will be done perfectly with the pitch and proposal complete. The game will contain exactly what the propsal claimed it would and be done with no big mistakes or missing features. The game I create will be just like the original creator made in the youtube video.
## 90+%
_What does 90+% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 90+%._

Everything will be done perfectly. The game will be completed exactly how the orginal video but contain extra, special and more advanced features. The game will be more personalized to the user and  possibly contain a feature where you can have two player games and compete against an actual person rather than a simple perosn vs computer game. The 90% plus grade will inlcude a perosn vs perosn feature where which ever user completes all the matches first, wins.
